                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Seattle has long been a beacon of hope for refugees from around the world. With a history of
                    welcoming diverse populations, the city has become a new home for thousands of individuals fleeing
                    conflict and persecution. This narrative explores the living and housing status of refugees in
                    Seattle, focusing on key neighborhoods such as Rainier Valley and Tukwila.</p>

            <section class="step" data-step="2">
                <h2>Rainier Valley</h2>
                <p>Rainier Valley is one of Seattle's most diverse neighborhoods, characterized by a rich cultural
                    tapestry and a significant refugee population. The area, particularly Rainier Beach, is home to
                    refugees from Somalia, Vietnam, Ethiopia, and many other countries. Community organizations in
                    Columbia City and Hillman City provide essential services, helping these individuals integrate into
                    the local society.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="step" data-step="3">
                <h2>Tukwila</h2>
                <p>Tukwila, just south of Seattle, has emerged as a critical haven for refugees. Nearly 40% of Tukwila's
                    population is foreign-born, with a significant number seeking refuge around the Riverton Park United
                    Methodist Church. This community hub has been pivotal in providing shelter and support to refugees
                    from countries like Venezuela, Angola, and Congo.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="step" data-step="4">
                <h2>Policy Interventions</h2>
                <p>Seattle's government has introduced various policy measures to address the housing needs of refugees.
                    Initiatives include affordable housing programs, partnerships with non-profits, and increased
                    funding for community support services. These measures aim to alleviate the housing crisis and
                    ensure refugees have access to safe and affordable housing.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="step" data-step="5">
                <h2>Is it Safe?</h2>
                <p>Studies indicate that the influx of refugees does not contribute to higher crime rates. In fact,
                    neighborhoods with higher refugee populations have seen a decrease in crime rates, debunking common
                    myths about refugees and crime.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="step" data-step="6">
                <h2>Are There Any Refugee-Related Incidents in Seattle?</h2>
                <p>While there have been isolated incidents involving refugees, these are not indicative of a broader
                    trend. An interactive map will show the location and nature of refugee-related incidents to provide
                    a clearer picture.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="step" data-step="7">
                <h2>Is it Livable?</h2>
                <p>The livability of Seattle for refugees depends on several factors, including access to affordable
                    housing, employment opportunities, and community support. Despite the challenges, many refugees have
                    found Seattle to be a welcoming and livable city.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="step" data-step="8">
                <h2>Is it Affordable?</h2>
                <p>The rising property values in Seattle pose a significant challenge for refugees seeking affordable
                    housing. We'll explore this issue using data from Zillow and Redfin to show the trends in housing
                    prices and their impact on the refugee population.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="step" data-step="9">
                <h2>Is it Accommodating to Their Needs?</h2>
                <p>Seattle offers a range of services to meet the needs of refugees, including healthcare, education,
                    and legal assistance. However, the availability and accessibility of these services vary across
                    different neighborhoods.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="step" data-step="10">
                <h2>Is it Accommodating to Their Religious Duties?</h2>
                <p>There are numerous places of worship for various religions in Seattle, catering to the spiritual
                    needs of the refugee communities. This section will map out the distribution of these places of
                    worship.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="step" data-step="11">
                <h2>Is it Accommodating to Their Culture?</h2>
                <p>Seattle is known for its cultural diversity and inclusivity. Various cultural centers and community
                    organizations help refugees maintain their cultural practices and traditions while integrating into
                    the broader society.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="step" data-step="12">
                <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                <p>Despite the challenges, the influx of refugees has enriched Seattle's cultural landscape. Data
                    indicates that refugees do not contribute to higher crime rates, debunking common myths. However,
                    the rising cost of living remains a significant hurdle. This narrative highlights the resilience of
                    refugee communities and the importance of continued support and policy intervention.</p>
